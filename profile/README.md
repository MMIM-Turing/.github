## Background and Description

Have you ever wanted to meet up with friend but did not know where to go? This app lets a user enter two addresses and then search for a location in the middle of those two addresses. The user can also chose to search for a specific category of results.

Using Google API the user is then sent to a page where they can see their results. A map is displayed on the page with pinpoints indicating the results. Then the user sees a list of results with an image, address, average rating, and a price range.

## The App

You can find the app on [heroku]().
